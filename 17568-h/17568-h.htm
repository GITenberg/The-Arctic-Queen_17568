<div class="poem">
<h3>PART FIRST.<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span><em class="smcap">Oene</em>, of all the chilly Arctics, queen,<br /></span>
<span>Ascended to her everlasting throne<br /></span>
<span>Built on the steadfast centre of the world,<br /></span>
<span>And waited for the middle hour of night,<br /></span>
<span>Now swiftly coming, to convene her court.<br /></span>
<span>Set in an ocean of perpetual calm<br /></span>
<span>Was the fair island honoured by her reign;<br /></span>
<span>Slowly around her rolled the Frigid Zone,<br /></span>
<span>Dim in the mystic moonlight far away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A silvery ring, circling her nearer realm<br /></span>
<span>With the pale lustre of its snowy walls,<br /></span>
<span>Defending from all storm and sudden change<br /></span>
<span>The sea which bathed the island's level shores.<br /></span>
<span>She sat upon her throne, and none might tell<br /></span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>
<span>Whether her limbs the lambent lustre cast<br /></span>
<span>Upon the pearls of which it was composed,<br /></span>
<span>Or they cast beauty on her glowing form.<br /></span>
<span>Around her feet a pavement spread, inlaid<br /></span>
<span>Of squares of roseate sea-shells, set about<br /></span>
<span>With purple gems, unknown in other lands;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Thence, winding paths, sprinkled with golden sand,<br /></span>
<span>Ran out, through bowers of flowers and fields of green<br /></span>
<span>To meet the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Low in the South the Moon<br /></span>
<span>Shone full against the island. The North-star,<br /></span>
<span>Sparkling and blazing like a silver sun,<br /></span>
<span>Stood at the Zenith, as a lamp hung out<br /></span>
<span>From heaven to charm the endless Arctic night;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And thus a soft profusion of pure light,<br /></span>
<span>More exquisite than sunshine, fell abroad.<br /></span>
<span>Unnipped by daintiest frosts, in every field<br /></span>
<span>Flowers crowded thick; and trees, not tall nor rude,<br /></span>
<span>With slender stems upholding feathery shade,<br /></span>
<span>Nodded their heads and hung their pliant limbs<br /></span>
<span>In natural bowers, sweet with delicious gloom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Queen <em class="smcap">Oene</em> sent her luminous glance afar:<br /></span>
<span>Fine rays of tintless light played round her head,<br /></span>
<span>Crowning her beauty with mysterious glory.<br /></span>
<span>She gazed away, beyond the tranquil sea,<br /></span>
<span>To distant mountains of unchanging snow,<br /></span>
<span>And still beyond, to where full many a tower<br /></span>
<span>And fortress reared their walls of gleaming ice<br /></span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
<span>On the dim verges of her vast domains.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Scarcely had she in silence throned herself,<br /></span>
<span>Ere from the trees, or flower-coves of the shore,<br /></span>
<span>Or gliding in from idling on the sea,<br /></span>
<span>Her maids of honor came, a virgin train,<br /></span>
<span>Like a bright constellation clustering round<br /></span>
<span>The central star, most glorious of them all.<br /></span>
<span>One, in a crimson blossom, torn away<br /></span>
<span>From its far moorings, nestled at her ease,<br /></span>
<span>Was seen slowly to skim the silver lake;<br /></span>
<span>While the huge flower seemed of itself propelled,<br /></span>
<span>Save that, by chance, a flushed and saucy face,<br /></span>
<span>Peeped from the waves, showing a little imp<br /></span>
<span>Who tugged at its stout stem with willful toil.<br /></span>
<span><em class="smcap">Kolona's</em> limbs and bosom roseate glowed<br /></span>
<span>As the slant moonlight through the crimson flower<br /></span>
<span>Bathed her with blushes; but, when on the strand<br /></span>
<span>She lightly sprang, flinging her tresses back,<br /></span>
<span>A southern maiden would have deemed her pale.<br /></span>
<span>Too rich for pallor was the polished glow<br /></span>
<span>Of her lithe figure; while, in either cheek,<br /></span>
<span>The red veins glimmered; dark blue were her eyes;<br /></span>
<span>Her tresses, like deep shadows, made more fair<br /></span>
<span>The light which they enhanced, glancing within.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The first to touch the white feet of the Queen<br /></span>
<span>And place herself at her right hand, was she.<br /></span>
<span>Others came soon; all bright, all beautiful,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>With deep blue eyes, and sweet mouths set in smiles.<br /></span>
<span>Long chains of jewels rare were, round their necks,<br /></span>
<span>Twined many times; these, flickering, rose and fell<br /></span>
<span>With the soft breath their full, graced bosoms drew.<br /></span>
<span>From waist to knee of each a tunic dropped<br /></span>
<span>In many folds, woven in changing hues<br /></span>
<span>Of birds' gay plumage, and fringed deep with gems,<br /></span>
<span>Which they with artless and unenvying pride,<br /></span>
<span>Would fain have made, each, most magnificent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>They gathered round their Queen, as midnight neared.<br /></span>
<span>Suddenly, with the hour, there came a change<br /></span>
<span>Over the moonlight and the courtly scene.<br /></span>
<span><em class="smcap">Oene</em> upon the pavement pressed her feet,<br /></span>
<span>And out the North-Lights sprang, to do her will,<br /></span>
<span>From secret caverns underneath its pearls.<br /></span>
<span>O'er all the land she bade them come and go;<br /></span>
<span>Each battlemented iceberg on the deep<br /></span>
<span>Of other seas, and every snowy hall,<br /></span>
<span>And every citadel by frosts upreared,<br /></span>
<span>Were lighted with wild splendors, as the troupes<br /></span>
<span>Of messengers rushed swiftly to and fro.<br /></span>
<span>The people of the Arctics knew their Queen<br /></span>
<span>Summoned her subjects to the Presence then<br /></span>
<span>By wavering tints which played beneath the Star,<br /></span>
<span>And the great speed with which the North-Lights flew.<br /></span>
<span>They hurried even to the Temperate Zone.<br /></span>
<span>A band of phantom spirits took wings and flew<br /></span>
<span>Far to the southern sky, a fluttering crowd.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>A warrior, yellow garbed, with fiery spear,<br /></span>
<span>Bestrode a frantic steed, and looked not back<br /></span>
<span>Till he alighted on a distant hill.<br /></span>
<span>With scintillant flames some perched on towers remote<br /></span>
<span>Or bore green banners o'er the mirroring sea,<br /></span>
<span>Or flitted through dim valleys, bright and fast,<br /></span>
<span>Casting their flickering shadows down the deep<br /></span>
<span>And awful solitudes of Arctic lands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Such of her people as had aught to ask<br /></span>
<span>Of favor or redress, from air and earth,<br /></span>
<span>Came now, bringing petitions, councils, gifts.<br /></span>
<span>Some slid on twinkling star-beams through the air,<br /></span>
<span>Some sailed in shallops over the light waves,<br /></span>
<span>And all who came had presents for their Queen,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Rare tints which they had caught just as the Moon<br /></span>
<span>Peered o'er the shoulder of the mighty Thug.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Those dwelling in the caverns of the sea<br /></span>
<span>Brought up the gayest jewels they could find,<br /></span>
<span>And pearls from underneath their low-based bergs<br /></span>
<span>Deep in the green waves, that, with thunderous sound,<br /></span>
<span>Did lull the giants of the North to sleep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>There came, as time rolled by, from the far verge<br /></span>
<span>Of her vast realm, the rugged guardian ghouls,<br /></span>
<span>Stationed in fortresses and waging war<br /></span>
<span>On all encroachers from the hated South.<br /></span>
<span>These had wild forms and gaunt; their dress was rude&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Skins of the white bear fastened to their loins.<br /></span>
<span>They bore long, glistening spears, and deadly clubs<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>Wrenched from the spines of monsters of the sea.<br /></span>
<span>Their gifts were rude as they, and yet their Queen<br /></span>
<span>Unbent the radiant quiet of her brow,<br /></span>
<span>Gazing with favor on these proofs of valor.<br /></span>
<span>Tales of achievements dread, of battles, deaths,<br /></span>
<span>Had they to speak, while, with pleased ear intent,<br /></span>
<span>Their sovereign listened.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">One warrior ghoul<br /></span>
<span>With crispy locks and frosty eyes, and breath<br /></span>
<span>Chiller than death's,&mdash;naked, as scorning e'en<br /></span>
<span>To wear the trophies of his fierce renown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Before the Presence stood, and told in haste,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>As half impatient of the wish to boast,<br /></span>
<span>Yet proud to serve so well&mdash;how he was called<br /></span>
<span><em class="smcap">Wole</em>, guardian of old Thug;&mdash;how from the South<br /></span>
<span>Came, ploughing slowly through the unwilling sea,<br /></span>
<span>A ship, crowded with mortals from that land;<br /></span>
<span>How, boldly, in defiance of commands<br /></span>
<span>Sent out by skirmishing Frosts, they still drew near,<br /></span>
<span>Passing the outer line of her domains;<br /></span>
<span>Daring to come, with their invading eyes,<br /></span>
<span>Where never mortals else had looked and lived.<br /></span>
<span>He told,&mdash;and here he glanced, upon his friends,<br /></span>
<span>Eyes of bright scorn&mdash;how the imperious ship<br /></span>
<span>Passed safely Tug and Dor, though all the guards<br /></span>
<span>Shot barbs of ice, and filled the air with fine,<br /></span>
<span>Invisible needles, piercing their pained flesh,<br /></span>
<span>And tore their stiffening sails with sharp-teethed winds;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>How, still, the ship pressed on where He kept watch,<br /></span>
<span>Ready to do new service for his Queen:<br /></span>
<span>How, as it closer came, he fixed his eyes<br /></span>
<span>Relentlessly upon it, till nor hand,<br /></span>
<span>Nor foot, nor eyelid of the fated crew<br /></span>
<span>Had power to stir, nor even the sails to flap,<br /></span>
<span>While banded winds which he sent forth, still drove<br /></span>
<span>The doomed ones onward to the eager shore,<br /></span>
<span>Where every soul had perished, one by one.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Thou hast done well, old <em class="smcap">Wole</em>,&quot; Queen <em class="smcap">Oene</em> said.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Stepping a pace in front of her companions,<br /></span>
<span>With bashful cheek, but with a kindling eye&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;'Tis not for one like me to have a thought<br /></span>
<span>In thy rare presence, Queen,&quot; <em class="smcap">Kolona</em> said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Yet I would dare to tell thee what I saw<br /></span>
<span>Only a moon ago, when a wild freak<br /></span>
<span>Possessed me to go voyaging alone,<br /></span>
<span>Across the sea, to find what curious things<br /></span>
<span>The other shore might hold. My lily bark,<br /></span>
<span>Being too frail for such a venturous cruise<br /></span>
<span>I borrowed <em class="smcap">Gondor's</em> boat of nautilus' shells,<br /></span>
<span>Put up my lua-leaf sail and swiftly sped<br /></span>
<span>Across the ocean, till this level isle<br /></span>
<span>Grew smaller than a star. The air grew cold:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I almost shivered in my bird's-down mantle;<br /></span>
<span>But when I neared the opposing shore, the sight<br /></span>
<span>Of all its snowy scenery, repaid me.<br /></span>
<span>Coasting along at leisure, on a cliff<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>Which overhung the sea, I saw appear<br /></span>
<span>A being, whom I knew at once as Man.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>One of that mortal race which we have kept<br /></span>
<span>Forever, since our chronicles began,<br /></span>
<span>With war assiduous, from our inner realms,<br /></span>
<span>Still undefiled by their invading feet.<br /></span>
<span>The choking hurry of my noisy heart<br /></span>
<span>Told me the truth. At first I would have fled,<br /></span>
<span>But, being unperceived by him, I lingered,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Inquisitive and wilful that I am.<br /></span>
<span>Thenceforth, sweet Queen, I never can forget<br /></span>
<span>The face of this one man which I have seen.<br /></span>
<span>Triumph was on his brow, and yet not that<br /></span>
<span>So much as doubt and earnest questioning.<br /></span>
<span>Something arose into his eyes and shone<br /></span>
<span>Which must have been his Soul; it searched the deep,<br /></span>
<span>The earth, the sky, with bright and troubled gaze;<br /></span>
<span>And then, glanced forward with so still a look,<br /></span>
<span>It seemed that it, perforce, would vanish space,<br /></span>
<span>And bring our secret world within its ken;<br /></span>
<span>Yet, with no cruelty or wantonness,<br /></span>
<span>Such as we hear gleamed from the cunning eyes<br /></span>
<span>Of those fierce hordes who, centuries ago,<br /></span>
<span>Came in their boats and strove to conquer us.<br /></span>
<span>Knowledge was what it craved, with truth it burned;<br /></span>
<span>A majesty we cannot name, expressed<br /></span>
<span>Its power within his features. Then I felt<br /></span>
<span>That, could I bring him to thy gracious feet<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>He would reveal to us that mystery<br /></span>
<span>The dream of which so oft hath troubled us,<br /></span>
<span>Breaking upon us, like the light of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span>Too high for us to fix its source&mdash;that spoke<br /></span>
<span>Of an eternal, comprehensive Life,<br /></span>
<span>The thought of which doth haunt us. In return<br /></span>
<span>We could bestow the knowledge which he craved,<br /></span>
<span>And link his name with ours through all the earth,<br /></span>
<span>Fearless of harm from one who only craves<br /></span>
<span>The crown of Genius for his soul-lit brow.<br /></span>
<span>Almost I rowed my shallop to his feet;<br /></span>
<span>Almost I offered to convey him hither,<br /></span>
<span>Yet feared so much, O, Queen, thy just displeasure,<br /></span>
<span>That I forbore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&quot;Long time he, gazing, stood;<br /></span>
<span>And when he turned, 'twas with so deep a sigh<br /></span>
<span>The sound awakened in me strange regret,<br /></span>
<span>Endless reproach, and grief before unknown.<br /></span>
<span>Art angry with thy maiden, peerless Queen?&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Over the lustrous forehead of <em class="smcap">Oene</em><br /></span>
<span>A shadow came, and deepened in her eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I might have slain thee both, if thou hadst ventured;<br /></span>
<span>For it is part of our ancestral law,<br /></span>
<span>The most immutable, to guard ourselves,<br /></span>
<span>With our severest powers, from envious Man.<br /></span>
<span>Yet, as thou sayest, he might have fed our hearts<br /></span>
<span>With sweet immortal food&mdash;aye, given us souls,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>If such things be,&mdash;worth half my priceless realms.<br /></span>
<span>No more&mdash;no more! <em class="smcap">Kolona</em>! take thy place!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>As a soft flower shrinks from the coming night,<br /></span>
<span>Amid protecting leaves, <em class="smcap">Kolona</em> shrank,<br /></span>
<span>Amid her tresses, from her sovereign's eyes,<br /></span>
<span>So gloomy yet so kind; and mutely stood<br /></span>
<span>Amid the bright and coyly wondering train.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>A band of sprites, armed with sharp, silver spears,<br /></span>
<span>With pearl-encrusted garb and gleaming sandals,<br /></span>
<span>Dwelling low down the land, even amid men,<br /></span>
<span>The Queen's advance guard, giving due alarm<br /></span>
<span>Of all attacks, taking short flights by night,<br /></span>
<span>And reconnoitering the southern world,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Had sent a group to counsel with their Queen.<br /></span>
<span>These, now, had much to say of an adventure<br /></span>
<span>Which took them almost to the Tropic Zone:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>How they had blighted fruit; and mildews cast<br /></span>
<span>Over the fields; and blasted flowering trees;<br /></span>
<span>Nipping the hopes of gaudy butterflies,<br /></span>
<span>Doting on honeyed flowers to fill their mouths;<br /></span>
<span>Chilling the saucy birds within their nests;<br /></span>
<span>Ruining the rainbow hues of many a garden;<br /></span>
<span>Pricking the insect world with their fine spears,<br /></span>
<span>And disappointing mortals of their wish.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Their somewhat boastful discourse these had ceased,<br /></span>
<span>When came in hosts a crowd around the Pole,<br /></span>
<span>Parting on each side to make way for one,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>A stranger, craving audience of their Queen.<br /></span>
<span>What saw those weird and piercing eyes, full turned<br /></span>
<span>To meet the coming throng?&mdash;a singular sight,<br /></span>
<span>Which filled them with bright anger and surprise!<br /></span>
<span>Up from the sea, along a silvery path,<br /></span>
<span>A mortal came; her girlish feet the first<br /></span>
<span>That ever pressed the veritable Pole;<br /></span>
<span>And not more strange to her was this wild queen,<br /></span>
<span>And all the fairness of these maids of honor,<br /></span>
<span>Than was her sunny beauty unto them.<br /></span>
<span>The fluttering brightness of her golden hair,<br /></span>
<span>The lustrous darkness of her eyes, the warmth<br /></span>
<span>Of tropic tints upon her brow and cheek,<br /></span>
<span>The dimpled fullness of her form, appeared<br /></span>
<span>In vivid contrast with their fairer charms.<br /></span>
<span>She held an offering of gorgeous flowers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Those most renowned for fragrance&mdash;in her hands,<br /></span>
<span>Which, as she reached the platform, she held forth<br /></span>
<span>With a most winning, most beseeching air.<br /></span>
<span>Amazed at such presumption, on the maid,<br /></span>
<span>Queen <em class="smcap">Oene</em>'s brow darkened in sudden wrath.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Warriors! do ye permit this sight!&quot; she cried.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The lightest breath of that majestic voice<br /></span>
<span>Had ever been with prompt obedience met;<br /></span>
<span>But now, though hoarse and deep as surging sea,<br /></span>
<span>No spear was lowered and no arrow bent.<br /></span>
<span>The Pole-Queen raised aloft her pale right arm;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>She stamped her haughty feet upon the pave,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And all the Powers of the vast Frigid Zone<br /></span>
<span>Were in commotion terrible:&mdash;the earth<br /></span>
<span>Shook till the people reeled, and reeling, fell;<br /></span>
<span>The circle of white gems about the throne<br /></span>
<span>Threw off strange darts of light which smote like steel:<br /></span>
<span>Swift whirling round with inconceivable speed<br /></span>
<span>A host of Northern Lights sprang into air,<br /></span>
<span>And, battling round their Queen, confused and wild,<br /></span>
<span>Blent with each other in the fierce affray.<br /></span>
<span>The frightened stars paled in the distant sky;<br /></span>
<span>And spectres rushed on shadowy steeds of grey<br /></span>
<span>Down the flushed firmament; and shining spears,<br /></span>
<span>Held by invisible hands, whirled high o'erhead.<br /></span>
<span>Pale mortals in the far off Torrid Zone<br /></span>
<span>Saw wonders in the Northern air with fear;<br /></span>
<span>And when an inward trembling shook the Pole<br /></span>
<span>Central through all the earth, in distant lands<br /></span>
<span>The mountains belched forth fire on fated cities.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Behind the throne suddenly arose a shower,<br /></span>
<span>As 'twere of phosphorescent flakes of snow,<br /></span>
<span>Straight upward like a fountain, and then fell<br /></span>
<span>In glowing sparks wide over all the land.<br /></span>
<span>The surging sea dashed its bewildered waves<br /></span>
<span>Against the foreheads of gigantic bergs,<br /></span>
<span>Walking, like drunken men, the noisy deep.<br /></span>
<span>Anon the <em class="smcap">Pole</em> was calm. Uninjured stood<br /></span>
<span>The mortal maid before the great <em class="smcap">Oene</em>;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>While near, a thousand prostrate subjects lay<br /></span>
<span>Slain by an angry sovereign disobeyed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Queen of this strange and spectral land, wilt thou<br /></span>
<span>Not show thy favor to a lonesome child<br /></span>
<span>Come wandering all this way, impelled by love?<br /></span>
<span>Not hate, ambition, curiosity,<br /></span>
<span>Have led me to thy fair and fearful presence.<br /></span>
<span>I have no power, am but a weak young girl;<br /></span>
<span>And chance, alone, has thus revealed to me<br /></span>
<span>The mystic glory of this unknown world,<br /></span>
<span>With thy bright self and this enchanted isle,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>This pearl upon the bosom of the deep<br /></span>
<span>So palely, purely fair&mdash;undreamed of beauty!<br /></span>
<span>Love is the sole excuse which I can urge<br /></span>
<span>For my intrusion&quot;&mdash;here the stranger blushed,<br /></span>
<span>Drooping in silence her embarrassed head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Speak on!&quot; imperially the Pole-Queen said,<br /></span>
<span>Charmed in her own despite, by that sweet face;<br /></span>
<span>While <em class="smcap">Lir-lir</em> to <em class="smcap">Kolona</em> leaned and smiled,<br /></span>
<span>Commending, in a whisper, what she saw:<br /></span>
<span>And a soft flutter through the courtly train<br /></span>
<span>Stirred, like the shimmer of a moonlit breeze<br /></span>
<span>Kissing the waves:&mdash;&quot;I will thy message hear!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And so the maiden, gathering courage, said:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Far in a blooming isle, in Southern seas,<br /></span>
<span>I had a home, whose walls, of marble cool,<br /></span>
<span>Were chequered by soft shadows, hovering,<br /></span>
<span>Like flocks of birds, about its battlements;<br /></span>
<span>For, all around, were trees, whose glistening leaves<br /></span>
<span>Danced ever, in the sunlight or the moonlight,<br /></span>
<span>To the soft flutes of the Arcadian winds;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>And to the sleepy music, drowsily<br /></span>
<span>The gorgeous flowers nodded their lovely heads.<br /></span>
<span>Through the bright days, and in my sleep at night,<br /></span>
<span>I heard the ripples breaking on the sand,<br /></span>
<span>Till their continual murmur grew to be<br /></span>
<span>A thing of course,&mdash;like sunshine and fresh air,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Or like the love which grew into my life,<br /></span>
<span>As color into flowers when they unfold.<br /></span>
<span>The fluttering foliage and the sighing waves<br /></span>
<span>Seemed whispering &quot;<em class="smcap">Bertho</em>!&quot; ever in my ear;<br /></span>
<span>For <em class="smcap">Bertho</em> was my lover, and my heart<br /></span>
<span>Could find no other meaning in their sound.<br /></span>
<span>I was a princess of that blooming isle;<br /></span>
<span>But <em class="smcap">Bertho</em>&mdash;he was poor! still, not so poor<br /></span>
<span>As brave, high-souled, and strangely venturesome.<br /></span>
<span>He trusted to the sea to gain his wealth,<br /></span>
<span>As well as knowledge and a manly fame.<br /></span>
<span>Ah! how I wept, when told that we must part!<br /></span>
<span>How much more bitter tears I shed that day<br /></span>
<span>On which he left me, wretched, by the shore,<br /></span>
<span>Watching the gleam of his receding sails!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Dim grew the golden air from that dark hour.<br /></span>
<span>Like some rich flower, torn from the wooing kiss<br /></span>
<span>Of the warm sun, and hidden in a cell,<br /></span>
<span>I drooped, and lost the redness of my cheeks.<br /></span>
<span>All the wild thrills that used to come and go,<br /></span>
<span>Tumultuous, through my happy heart, and send<br /></span>
<span>The pulses flying through my frame, died out.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And thus in sadness two long summers passed.<br /></span>
<span>In madness or in wisdom my poor brain<br /></span>
<span>Wrought out a vision in my troubled sleep,<br /></span>
<span>Through which I saw my <em class="smcap">Bertho</em>, and he bade<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>My soul be still and fear not,&mdash;I should take<br /></span>
<span>My little boat, in which I used to skirt<br /></span>
<span>The island shores, and loose it on the deep,<br /></span>
<span>Placing myself within it:&mdash;It would come,<br /></span>
<span>By force of an unknown and magic current,<br /></span>
<span>(The thought of which, in speculative minds,<br /></span>
<span>Had long been cherished,) straightway to the shore<br /></span>
<span>Of the strange country where, enthralled, he dwelt.<br /></span>
<span>If I still loved him, this would prove my love!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Straight from my couch I rose, and like a ghost<br /></span>
<span>Stole through the darkness of my father's halls;<br /></span>
<span>Fled to the sea; and in my fragile bark<br /></span>
<span>I heaped a few fresh fruits, and bore a vase<br /></span>
<span>Filled with fresh water,&mdash;this was all my store.<br /></span>
<span>I loosed my shallop from the anchoring rock,<br /></span>
<span>And, as it drifted out upon the tide,<br /></span>
<span>I leaned upon the single, slender oar<br /></span>
<span>Whose aid was all I asked upon the deep.<br /></span>
<span>Before my yearning vision lay my home,<br /></span>
<span>Fading away from sight as the full tide<br /></span>
<span>Went murmuring back from its delightful shores.<br /></span>
<span>The loveliest hour of all the twenty-four<br /></span>
<span>Charmed earth and ocean, that eventful time.<br /></span>
<span>Moonlight and morning, softly blending, lay<br /></span>
<span>Upon the land; while down the glassy sea,<br /></span>
<span>Far in the distance, slowly stole a band<br /></span>
<span>Of sunrise glories, smiling, looking back,<br /></span>
<span>And glowing with warm splendors. All the East<br /></span>
<span>Was crimson with their blushes, and the waves<br /></span>
<span>Which followed in their bright and stately way<br /></span>
<span>Wore crests of gold, and purple-shaded robes.<br /></span>
<span>Next came light breezes blowing from the land,<br /></span>
<span>Odorous with roses, sweet with drowsy songs<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>Of nightingales, and cool with myrtle leaves,<br /></span>
<span>Following down the path the sunrise took.<br /></span>
<span>And next, the stars went dimly down the west,<br /></span>
<span>Crowd upon crowd, in slow and shining cars,<br /></span>
<span>Bright wheeling down their heaven-appointed way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;All day the sun shadowed himself in clouds;<br /></span>
<span>My cheeks scarce browned beneath his cooled rays.<br /></span>
<span>At night I sank contentedly to sleep,<br /></span>
<span>Upon the silken cushions of my bark;<br /></span>
<span>Then mermaids, who, attracted by my voice,<br /></span>
<span>Had floated round me, underneath the waves,<br /></span>
<span>Not daring to appear, swam near, reached out<br /></span>
<span>Their arms of glowing white, and touched the boat.<br /></span>
<span>Charmed by the helplessness of sleep in me,<br /></span>
<span>They chanted sea-hymns, and I, straightway, dreamed<br /></span>
<span>Of tinkling fountains in my father's halls,<br /></span>
<span>And how my lover sat beside me there,<br /></span>
<span>Murmuring his words of love in my thrilled ear.<br /></span>
<span>They rocked the bark, too, with their lily hands,<br /></span>
<span>As tender mothers rock their cradled babes:<br /></span>
<span>And one wild sea-nymph reached and touched my hair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I saw her through my dream!&mdash;and one unstrung<br /></span>
<span>The pearls from out her own wave-wetted locks,<br /></span>
<span>And flung them by me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&quot;The fresh morn waked me;<br /></span>
<span>A current, gentle as a musical sound,<br /></span>
<span>Swept the boat onward, as by magic power.<br /></span>
<span>At times I thought, perchance, the nymphs beneath<br /></span>
<span>Propelled it, but when I recalled my dream,<br /></span>
<span>I knew some freak of nature, or some law,<br /></span>
<span>By me uncomprehended, did the work.<br /></span>
<span>At night I heard the naiads, in a tone<br /></span>
<span>As soft as shepherd's reed, sing ocean-songs;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>And sometimes, in the day, above the wave<br /></span>
<span>I for a moment saw a lovely face,<br /></span>
<span>Pearled in a clinging mass of shell-wreathed hair,<br /></span>
<span>Peering upon me with strange, smiling eyes.<br /></span>
<span>Gay fishes, in the sunlight gleaming, swam<br /></span>
<span>With playful fires of evanescent hues;<br /></span>
<span>And birds did sometimes rest their weary wings<br /></span>
<span>Upon my shoulder, pecking at the fruit<br /></span>
<span>Which I did share with them, though small my store.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Thus on and on continuous days I fled;<br /></span>
<span>No wind came now, blowing from flowery shores,<br /></span>
<span>At times to startle me with dreams of home;<br /></span>
<span>No more bewildering songs rose all the night<br /></span>
<span>Around me; nor familiar faces glanced<br /></span>
<span>An instant from the deep; nor long, fair fingers<br /></span>
<span>Hung on the gilded prow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&quot;The Temperate Zone<br /></span>
<span>Had floated by like a long stream of gold;<br /></span>
<span>The Arctics lay before me, vast and drear;<br /></span>
<span>The sea was green and rough; no gay fish darted<br /></span>
<span>Like silver arrows from the quivering wave;<br /></span>
<span>But monsters, with thick scales and hideous eyes,<br /></span>
<span>Looked sullenly up in stupid wonderment,<br /></span>
<span>While some swam to'ards me, with rapacious maws<br /></span>
<span>Sharp-fanged and bloody, and exulting fins<br /></span>
<span>Flapping with demon slowness their huge sides;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And still I passed unhurt.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&quot;Once round my boat<br /></span>
<span>For many hours an old sea-dragon hovered.<br /></span>
<span>His huge folds lay like rainbows on the sea,<br /></span>
<span>And his two eyes, like suns, resplendent shone.<br /></span>
<span>He seemed to guard thy realm, O, mighty Queen!<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>And, with the cunning power of those large eyes,<br /></span>
<span>To awe intruders from thy frozen world.<br /></span>
<span>So fearlessly my gaze repelled his own<br /></span>
<span>I charmed this wary dragon of the North;<br /></span>
<span>The eyes that erst had sparkled goldenly<br /></span>
<span>With a malicious and infatuous brightness,<br /></span>
<span>Grew lost and dreaming in a vacant splendor;<br /></span>
<span>The rainbow lustre of his lengthening folds<br /></span>
<span>Faded to harmless green, till, prone, he lay,<br /></span>
<span>A floating dream of dread, upon the deep;<br /></span>
<span>Then, with the noiseless current drifting on,<br /></span>
<span>I passed your subtle guardian swiftly by;<br /></span>
<span>While only one faint sparkle, green and gold,<br /></span>
<span>Broke from his sluggish sides as I swept past.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The grandeur of your floating towers of ice<br /></span>
<span>Stole on my sight; the sea rolled rough; the air<br /></span>
<span>Was sharp and clear; and yet this delicate robe<br /></span>
<span>Was all sufficient to resist its power.<br /></span>
<span>Soon, upon every side, I saw tall bergs.<br /></span>
<span>A child of fragrant airs and sunny skies,<br /></span>
<span>Enervate with the South's soft luxuries,<br /></span>
<span>These icebergs burst upon me like a sense<br /></span>
<span>Newly received, revealing God anew.<br /></span>
<span>While in the distance, calmly floating on<br /></span>
<span>Through the broad sunlight, then I loved to dream<br /></span>
<span>That they were palaces upreared by gnomes,<br /></span>
<span>With glittering towers and silver pinnacles,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>That in them were expanded halls of light&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Vast chambers&mdash;with such gorgeous, fretted roofs<br /></span>
<span>And shining floors, as wearied human sight;<br /></span>
<span>That fountains filled them with a slumberous sound;<br /></span>
<span>And curtains, wrought of silver-threaded frost,<br /></span>
<span>Were looped with priceless pearls from room to room;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>A home for all the spirits of the Good<br /></span>
<span>Lost in the pitiless sea,&mdash;where they would bathe<br /></span>
<span>Their thoughts in heaven's splendor, looking out<br /></span>
<span>The golden windows towards the constant sun,<br /></span>
<span>Shining, unceasing, slant against their brows.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;But, as I nearer drew, I lost that dream<br /></span>
<span>In one more gloomy. They did seem to shape<br /></span>
<span>Themselves to living giants; lifting high<br /></span>
<span>Their frowning foreheads, crowned with fiery crowns.<br /></span>
<span>As lower sank the sun towards the sea,<br /></span>
<span>Gloomier did they grow, with their white hair<br /></span>
<span>And lifted spears, walking with mighty steps<br /></span>
<span>The creaking floor of the unsteady deep.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Nodding defiantly at one another&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Meeting, with crashing spears and splintered shields,<br /></span>
<span>With hoarse cries, breast to breast, in angry strife;<br /></span>
<span>Their armor shivered at their feet, the sea<br /></span>
<span>Broken beneath their tread and shuddering<br /></span>
<span>At the great shock.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&quot;More thick these terrors grew;<br /></span>
<span>Broad fields stretched out in many a frozen ridge;<br /></span>
<span>While far beyond were paths of printless snow.<br /></span>
<span>The ocean lay behind; and yet my boat<br /></span>
<span>Moved ever onward, up a watery isle,<br /></span>
<span>Opening, like a deep river, through the ice.<br /></span>
<span>A shadowy land spread out on either side,<br /></span>
<span>Where, moveless as some black and brooding bird,<br /></span>
<span>Night hovered, silent, vast, and wonderful.<br /></span>
<span>Thy Heralds, the North-Lights, did startle me<br /></span>
<span>Into new wonder by their glowing shapes,<br /></span>
<span>Swift rushing down the sky, those phantasms wild,<br /></span>
<span>Flushing, and paling in their measureless speed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>At length I drifted into a new sea,<br /></span>
<span>Where all was calm and warm, and where no tower<br /></span>
<span>Of ragged ice upreared itself. On, on<br /></span>
<span>I floated, while some lovely fantasy<br /></span>
<span>Seemed stealing my true sense&mdash;so fair the scene.<br /></span>
<span>Huge lillies, which no tropic land might boast,<br /></span>
<span>Slept on the water&mdash;like embodied moonlight;<br /></span>
<span>A mellow lustre bathed all things; sweet birds<br /></span>
<span>With rainbow plumage fluttered through the air,<br /></span>

<span>From too much watching?&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span>For the far Frigid Zone&mdash;the wild, the fierce,<br /></span>
<span>The unknown Arctic seas&mdash;through their cold depths,<br /></span>
<span>Their intricate, unmarked, majestic ways,<br /></span>
<span>To find a North-West Passage: which wise men<br /></span>
<span>And skillful mariners, learned of the sea,<br /></span>
<span>Suspected, through the navigator's art<br /></span>
<span>Might to the world be opened. High my heart<br /></span>

<span>Prosperous we were, till o'er the mystic bounds<br /></span>
<span>Of <em class="smcap">Oene's</em> realms I sailed; save now and then<br /></span>
<span>Some noble sailor of my kindly crews<br /></span>

<span>Slaying the rein-deer by their snow-built huts:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>On, through the thickening perils of the way!<br /></span>

<span>Nor with his wavering arrows could o'erthrow<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Now from <em class="smcap">Oene's</em> dominions, messengers,<br /></span>

<span>It bore down upon us with such grand array<br /></span>
<span>As I pray heaven never to see again.<br /></span>
<span>An hundred giant ships, whose rainbow sails<br /></span>
<span>And glittering masts towered a thousand feet<br /></span>
<span>Above our tiny vessels, weighed their anchors<br /></span>
<span>And slowly from their harbors drifted out.<br /></span>
<span>We heard the creaking of their cables&mdash;heard<br /></span>
<span>The shouting of their fierce and naked crews&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>We saw the green sea boil against their keels&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Their viewless banners flapped against our faces&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Their viewless darts pierced us on every side<br /></span>
<span>Till men fell on our decks, a stony heap.<br /></span>
<span>We strove, at least, to make a brave retreat,<br /></span>
<span>Toiling in mute dispair, or madly praying<br /></span>
<span>The winds to favor our poor, shattered sails.<br /></span>
<span>They closed around us upon every side.<br /></span>
<span>Two of the largest of their avenging fleet,<br /></span>
<span>Drawing together crushed in the embrace<br /></span>
<span>My stoutest vessel like some frailest shell;<br /></span>
<span>Then swung apart, with laughter on their decks,<br /></span>
<span>Showing me, where my noble friends had been,<br /></span>
<span>Only a seething gulf. The sweat of anguish<br /></span>
<span>Froze into hail upon my pallid brow,<br /></span>
<span>When, with another shriek of agony,<br /></span>
<span>The brother ship went down. At length the winds,<br /></span>
<span>Saving us only from more sudden death,<br /></span>
<span>Drove us upon the rocks beneath this mount.<br /></span>
<span>Five years had wasted all our store of food;<br /></span>
<span>But, seeing monsters like this beast of prey,<br /></span>
<span>Some of the least exhausted boldly forth<br /></span>
<span>Went to destroy them&mdash;I amid the rest,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>But stupor and a drowsy sweetness came<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>Over our eyes, and we lay down to sleep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Waking to hear the mocking laugh of ghouls,<br /></span>

<span>Brief time it was, 'till, with bewildered eyes,<br /></span>
<span>She saw her fairies vanish in a mist,<br /></span>
<span>Floating away in music, while she stood<br /></span>
<span>Alone, far down the mountain opposite<br /></span>
<span>The side that with such toil she just had climbed.<br /></span>
<span>She stood alone&mdash;and where? the roses shrank<br /></span>
<span>From her wan cheeks to view her new distress,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Before her a dark chasm, and above her<br /></span>
<span>A crowd of close and overhanging rocks,<br /></span>
<span>All dripping, black, and hopelessly down-leant.<br /></span>
<span>A glimmering hope now broke upon her sense&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Seeing an arch, and, far beyond, the gleam<br /></span>
<span>Of lights that from some cavern stole away.<br /></span>
<span>Under the arch she passed and found herself<br /></span>
<span>Walking an ever-widening vista down,<br /></span>
<span>Fading from twilight to auroral glows<br /></span>
<span>And brightening into more than noon-day breadth<br /></span>
<span>And gorgeousness of light, until she paused<br /></span>
<span>Beneath the grand arch of that grand succession,<br /></span>
<span>Standing amazed, one slender hand upheld<br /></span>
<span>Shading her eyes, half blinded by that view<br /></span>
<span>Of Arctic-Nature and of Arctic-Art.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>In limitless magnificence the cave<br /></span>

<span>Searching for Adam; and yet, oft beguiled<br /></span>
<span>From the great love-thought, by the sights she saw.<br /></span>
<span>If she glanced upward to the sparkling dome,<br /></span>
<span>The lamps, swinging like suns as far above,<br /></span>
<span>Shone down upon her beautiful young face,<br /></span>
<span>Smiling to see them dwarfed within her eyes.<br /></span>
<span>The crystal floor doubled her bashful feet;<br /></span>
<span>She saw no walls; but the refulgent space<br /></span>
<span>Was here and there disturbed by artful groups.<br /></span>
<span>Once, by a fountain passing, dulcet murmurs,<br /></span>
<span>Wooed her aside to listen; and, again,<br /></span>
<span>Temples, which mimicked the frost's fairy work,<br /></span>
<span>Burning with gems, attracted her to gaze.<br /></span>
<span>Music, from hidden sources, beat the air<br /></span>
<span>With wings of melody that flew abroad<br /></span>
<span>Beyond th' enchanted sense, and darting back<br /></span>
<span>Swept with a sweet vibration near her face.<br /></span>
<span>Thrice o'er her brow she drew her languid hand,<br /></span>
<span>That, if it were a dream, she might dispel<br /></span>
<span>The gay enchantment; and thrice murmured o'er<br /></span>
<span>The spells learned of her nurse in infancy,<br /></span>
<span>Which would all witchcraft render innocent;<br /></span>
<span>But that great cavern of the northern world<br /></span>
<span>Was not by nurse's spells to be dissolved,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Now, 'neath her feet, the floor less polished grew,<br /></span>

<span>And heard a discord in the melody<br /></span>

<span><em class="smcap">Oene</em> was coming with her virgin train,<br /></span>
<span>Impatient to behold what further charms,<br /></span>
<span>Her prisoned laborers at their tasks had wrought.<br /></span>
<span>Blowing on quaintly curved and curious shells<br /></span>
<span>Which made a sea-like music&mdash;mingled up<br /></span>
<span>Of sweet, unsyllabled sounds, and long-drawn sighs,<br /></span>
<span>Heavy with memories of coral reefs,<br /></span>
<span>Murmuring shores, caverns, and surging deeps&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>A band of sprites which lived in air or sea;<br /></span>

<span>And cheeks puffed out and flushing with their toil.<br /></span>
<span>Announced by these, the courtly train approached<br /></span>
<span>The spot where <em class="smcap">Bertho</em> and his <em class="smcap">Olive</em> stood,<br /></span>
<span>Close by an emrald rock, within whose breast<br /></span>

<span>And rare similitudes of southern flowers;<br /></span>
<span>Shaped violets from sapphires, and from stalks,<br /></span>
<span>Hung ruby roses, bright, but without soul,<br /></span>
<span>As perfumeless as was that frigid land.<br /></span>

<span>That ever beat its heart out in a cage,<br /></span>
<span>Fluttered the pinions of her restless will<br /></span>
<span>In vain against her dungeon. What cared she<br /></span>
<span>That this same dungeon had an emrald floor<br /></span>
<span>And lattice-work of gold, or that the spring<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>Which closed the door, was on a jewel hinged?<br /></span>
<span>The lustre of the cave flowed through her cell,<br /></span>
<span>And she could strain her weary eyes to catch<br /></span>
<span>Glimpses of splendor, which but mocked her state.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The tiresome days rolled round, never relieved<br /></span>
<span>By the refreshing shadows of the night;<br /></span>
<span>Until the lamps so often counted o'er,<br /></span>
<span>Seemed burning in her brain; and she had fears<br /></span>
<span>That madness lurked within her feverish veins.<br /></span>
<span>The ghouls who chanced to pass her, never spake;<br /></span>
<span>At last, with joy, the stranger of the mount<br /></span>
<span>She saw approaching:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&quot;Ah! Sir <em class="smcap">John</em>,&quot; she cried&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Her pale face, peering through the lattice-work&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Thou find'st me in a miserable plight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A closer prisoner by far than thou.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Why, thou bright bird, has <em class="smcap">Oene</em> caged thee here&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Prisoned an oriole in her Arctic bowers?<br /></span>
<span>'Tis well we meet. As I was solacing<br /></span>
<span>My banishment, by wandering here and there,<br /></span>
<span>Greeting old Thug by the day's sickly smile,<br /></span>
<span>I chanced within this cavern, where surprise<br /></span>
<span>And pleasure lured me on from scene to scene.<br /></span>
<span>What tyrant holds thee in this glittering cell?&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;From <em class="smcap">Oene's</em> anger I am suffering,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Yes, dear sir <em class="smcap">John</em>, from more than angry hate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>From that implacable passion, worst of all,<br /></span>
<span>And cruelest of purpose, jealousy.<br /></span>
<span>I'd trust the tenderness of hungry wolves,<br /></span>
<span>The beauty of the cobra, or the talk<br /></span>
<span>Of waters to the rocks&mdash;but not the will<br /></span>
<span>Of woman, when to jealous thoughts aroused.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>She binds me here and bears my love away,<br /></span>
<span>To tempt him with a thousand sweetest wiles&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>With beauty, wealth, ambition, vanity,<br /></span>
<span>And all that easiest moves a man's proud heart.<br /></span>
<span>How shall I know if <em class="smcap">Bertho</em>&mdash;<i>even he</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Has truth or virtue beyond this rich price?<br /></span>
<span>Or, she may torture him,&mdash;by pain compel<br /></span>
<span>Consent to her soft wish and queenly will.<br /></span>
<span>Alas, Sir <em class="smcap">John</em>, I am very miserable!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Shall I not play the messenger, and urge<br /></span>
<span>Thy cause before her, if, by inquiry,<br /></span>

<span>&quot;Oh, if thou would'st and yet&mdash;what should I gain?<br /></span>
<span>Nothing, nothing!&mdash;still, I should hear from <i>him</i>&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>And thank thee from my heart, if thou wilt go!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Long time Sir <em class="smcap">John</em>, misled by wicked sprites,<br /></span>
<span>Searched for the Queen! until, by some kind chance,<br /></span>
<span>He wandered through a grotto by the sea,<br /></span>
<span>Where silver pendules from the ceiling hung<br /></span>
<span>And gossip ripples whispered at the door.<br /></span>
<span>Here, on a seat from solid crystal hewn<br /></span>
<span>Sat <em class="smcap">Oene</em>,&mdash;<em class="smcap">Bertho</em> at her feet,&mdash;her hand<br /></span>
<span>Nestled amid the ringlets of his hair,<br /></span>
<span>Like some white dove amid the wav'ring shade;<br /></span>
<span>Her eyes bent softly on his countenance;<br /></span>
<span>The crimson of his fiery southern blood<br /></span>
<span>Burned through the brown of his defiant cheek;<br /></span>
<span>His eyes were downcast, that their sullen fire<br /></span>
<span>Should not too much betray him, as he lay,<br /></span>
<span>A half-tamed lion at his mistress' feet,<br /></span>
<span>Restless, yet yielding to the golden chain.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>In a low voice, which, like a pent-up stream,<br /></span>
<span>Chafed at its boundaries, he made reply<br /></span>
<span>To her incessant questions of the world,<br /></span>
<span>Of human life and love, of death, and heaven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>When bold Sir <em class="smcap">John</em> intruded on the scene<br /></span>
<span><em class="smcap">Oene</em> resumed her native haughtiness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I've come to plead the cause of a sweet child,<br /></span>
<span>Who, like a wild-bird newly caught and caged,<br /></span>
<span>Within her cell is fretting. Noble Queen,<br /></span>
<span>I'm not an eloquent nor fair young man,<br /></span>
<span>To please a gentle fancy; but my tongue<br /></span>
<span>And mind shall do thy bidding, should there be<br /></span>
<span>Aught which my humble wisdom could expound.<br /></span>
<span>The meanwhile he who now instructs thee, hastes<br /></span>
<span>To ope the prison door and let the bird<br /></span>
<span>Flutter to her true home within his breast.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Scarce were these words with a firm purpose said,<br /></span>
<span>When all the scene was changed. Where erst a Queen,<br /></span>
<span>In shape most loveable, did blushing sit,<br /></span>
<span>A terrible and yet a glorious form<br /></span>
<span>Rose in portentious wrath; her star-crowned head<br /></span>
<span>Paled the chaste lustre of the silvery dome.<br /></span>
<span>It was no shame to him that <em class="smcap">Bertho</em> fled,<br /></span>
<span>Dismayed, before the anger of her eyes,<br /></span>
<span>For they were awful. Parted from Sir <em class="smcap">John</em>,<br /></span>
<span>And flying through a dark, unknown ravine,<br /></span>
<span>He lost himself in tangled labyrinths:<br /></span>
<span>Stumbling o'er rocks&mdash;only by daring leaps<br /></span>
<span>Saving himself from dropping into chasms<br /></span>
<span>Which opened suddenly across his path.<br /></span>
<span>From tortuous windings underneath the ground,<br /></span>
<span>At length released, he thenceforth knew the way,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>And sped across the mountain to the cave<br /></span>
<span>Where <em class="smcap">Olive</em> pined, weeping despairing tears.<br /></span>
<span>Like a swift arrow through the sunlight shot<br /></span>
<span>He passed athwart its glory, till he reached<br /></span>
<span>Her prison&mdash;heard her sudden cry of joy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Touched the elaborate spring which bound her in,<br /></span>
<span>And freed her, while she gazed in mute surprise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Love! look not thus incredulous of hope!<br /></span>
<span>This temple was thy lover's handiwork&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>This curious spring he wrought,&mdash;and what he did<br /></span>
<span>He can undo. My sweetest! it is I:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Thy living, breathing <em class="smcap">Bertho</em> stands before thee!<br /></span>
<span>This happiness, at least, I owe the Queen,<br /></span>
<span>Who, since repentant, may her gift resume,<br /></span>
<span>Should Heaven not grant us now a quick escape.<br /></span>
<span>But once&mdash;this once&mdash;though death should press me next&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Come to my arms&mdash;to thy dear bosom draw me,<br /></span>
<span>So fondly close!&mdash;and feed my famished lips<br /></span>
<span>With kisses worth a life of wo to gain!<br /></span>
<span>Nay, pause not to inquire&mdash;'tis better thus<br /></span>
<span>To feel the throbbing of thy timid heart,<br /></span>
<span>Than to waste breath in words.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&quot;How did it come?<br /></span>
<span>I know not: I was tranced in sleep profound,<br /></span>
<span>And when I woke I was my former self.<br /></span>
<span>Queen <em class="smcap">Oene</em> hoped my gratitude would grow<br /></span>
<span>To love, in time; and I was grateful&mdash;would<br /></span>
<span>Have given her everything but what was thine,<br /></span>
<span>And that alone she coveted. Come, sweet!<br /></span>
<span>Fly from this land forlorn:&mdash;if miracles<br /></span>
<span>Are still in fashion, one might serve us well.<br /></span>
<span>Cling to my guiding hand; trust all to me;<br /></span>
<span>My soul is so elate I would not flinch<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>From meeting every imp of this dark land&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The touch of thy soft hand is such a triumph!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Even while his accents lingered, they were gone<br /></span>
<span>By an obscure and solitary path,<br /></span>
<span>Until they came upon some rough-hewn steps,<br /></span>
<span>Which wandered round and down, interminable.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A stairway leading to the upper world<br /></span>
<span>For the ascent of gnomes, who dwelt beneath<br /></span>
<span>In those huge tidal caves which underlaid<br /></span>
<span>Old Thug, upheaved from earth in ancient times.<br /></span>
<span>Silent the lovers fled; their locks grew wet<br /></span>
<span>With mildew, and their breath came gaspingly.<br /></span>
<span>A sound of gibbering gnomes, of elfish song&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Mingling high discords with the patient clink<br /></span>
<span>Of instruments of toil&mdash;of laughter strange&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Warned them of the wild laborers they must meet.<br /></span>
<span>A moment more, and the pale fugitives<br /></span>
<span>Stood at the bottom of those countless steps,<br /></span>
<span>Peering into the lowest deep of all.<br /></span>
<span>A hell-like spot! and spirits of the doomed<br /></span>
<span>Were scarce more haggard than the clumsy elves<br /></span>
<span>Who here pursued their coarse and perilous toil.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>'Tis in these horrible caverns, deep and wide,<br /></span>
<span>Each day the ocean sinks, when, rushing round<br /></span>
<span>With the swift world, he falls into this snare;<br /></span>
<span>From whence with groans, and anger impotent,<br /></span>
<span>He backward struggles to his bed of sand<br /></span>
<span>And lies there panting; while the credulous earth,<br /></span>
<span>Dreaming of love, looks on him with a smile,<br /></span>
<span>Saying&mdash;&quot;He pineth for the sweet-faced Moon;&quot;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Thus had he just receded, when the pair<br /></span>
<span>Stood peering shuddering in, hearing afar<br /></span>
<span>The painful sighs, which shook his savage breast.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>The dwarfish elves, with waning lamps in hand,<br /></span>
<span>Creeping like worms along the slimy floor,<br /></span>
<span>Pursued the ebbing tide collecting spoils.<br /></span>
<span>The lovers saw from what exhaustless mines<br /></span>
<span>Were gathered up the overwhelming wealth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The jewels and the curious costly toys<br /></span>
<span>Which graced <em class="smcap">Oene</em> and all her splendid court;<br /></span>
<span>For there the sea,&mdash;forever wrecking treasures,<br /></span>
<span>Gulping down golden argosies at once&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Leaves them behind him in his angry flight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Art thou afraid, my darling?&quot; <em class="smcap">Bertho</em> asked&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;I'll bear thee safely through this hideous place.<br /></span>
<span>Here <em class="smcap">Lucifer</em>, I think, must love to linger;<br /></span>
<span>The shrieking of the ocean hath a sound<br /></span>
<span>Like the united wail of hopeless souls;<br /></span>
<span>Here darkness dwells in everlasting sleep;<br /></span>
<span>For these poor, puny lights which wander round,<br /></span>
<span>Scarce make the drowsy lashes of his lids<br /></span>
<span>Tremble o'er his blind eyes;&mdash;the heated earth<br /></span>
<span>Gives forth the odors of her burning heart,<br /></span>
<span>In whose incessant fires her vitals wither.<br /></span>
<span>See! where those wretched gnomes are dragging chests,<br /></span>
<span>Banded with iron! most like, is heaped within<br /></span>
<span>The ingots of some drowned West-Indian:<br /></span>
<span>And look! ah heaven! how beautiful and strange,<br /></span>
<span>To see the delicate corpse of this young girl<br /></span>
<span>Like marble petrified, the raven hair<br /></span>
<span>Grown rankly long, trailing around her limbs,<br /></span>
<span>And clinging to her lovely, breathless breast!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>That rude dwarf clutching from her helpless hands<br /></span>
<span>The jewels which some friend or lover gave.<br /></span>
<span>If we had time to give our fancies range,<br /></span>
<span>What a wild story we would make of this!&quot;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>Thrilling with pity, <em class="smcap">Olive</em> hid her eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Twelve hours of desperate flight, and they emerged<br /></span>
<span>From darkness to a dead shore, shrouded white,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Saw the green ocean rolling, saw the Sun,<br /></span>
<span>Pale, like a wounded God, and weary, hang<br /></span>
<span>Low in the southern sky&mdash;saw mountains crowned<br /></span>
<span>With snow and fire&mdash;saw motionless cataracts<br /></span>
<span>Hanging like frozen rainbows over chasms&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And icebergs settling downward towards the sun<br /></span>
<span>As if to pierce him with their glist'ning spears.<br /></span>
<span>Remotely, to the North, the Polar Sea<br /></span>
<span>Hung like a roseate cloud along the sky<br /></span>
<span>Fringing with lovely tints the dim horizon,<br /></span>
<span>Holding unseen its island star within.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;A miracle!&quot; quoth <em class="smcap">Bertho</em>; &quot;Love, observe<br /></span>
<span>How all these waves set from the shore, and glide<br /></span>
<span>Like a broad river, 'twixt these frozen banks.<br /></span>
<span>The current which ran northward with thy boat,<br /></span>
<span>Has overtopped the Pole, and flows away,<br /></span>
<span>A liquid belt, girdling the earth. Alas!<br /></span>
<span>We have no trusty boat in which to launch,<br /></span>
<span>Once more, our fortunes on the promising deep.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Wearied, they flung themselves upon the shore,<br /></span>
<span>And, hand in hand, sat gazing on the sea<br /></span>
<span>With home-sick longing. <em class="smcap">Wole</em>, the eager-eyed,<br /></span>
<span>From his far height espied them where they sat,<br /></span>
<span>And sent four of his people to their aid<br /></span>
<span>(Such power hath youth and beauty through the world!)<br /></span>
<span>Bearing a skiff, contrived of ribs of whales,<br /></span>
<span>For frame work,&mdash;these, inwove with fibrous moss,<br /></span>
<span>And lined with furs of savage Arctic beasts<br /></span>
<span>Which he had slain. When, with this welcome gift<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>The slaves appeared, and bowed at <em class="smcap">Olive's</em> feet,<br /></span>
<span>The tears sprang to her eyes; her heart was touched<br /></span>
<span>By this rude warrior's magnanimity.<br /></span>
<span>They put to sea. Scarce were they free from land,<br /></span>
<span>When, o'er the plain they saw <em class="smcap">Oene</em> advance,<br /></span>
<span>Alone and melancholy, to the shore.<br /></span>
<span>Her anger was subdued by greater grief;<br /></span>
<span>While something new and holier than sorrow<br /></span>
<span>Restrained revenge. It was the Love Divine<br /></span>
<span>Which sacrifices self to others' good.<br /></span>
<span>Some word, Sir <em class="smcap">John</em> had uttered when her wrath<br /></span>
<span>Would have consumed him, fell upon her heart<br /></span>
<span>Like rain on a thirsty garden&mdash;there sprang up<br /></span>
<span>The amaranthine flower of charity<br /></span>
<span>Whose seed was dropped from heaven; the nameless pain,<br /></span>
<span>The want, which she had ever felt, was gone;<br /></span>
<span>She knew the immortal meaning of the Soul,<br /></span>
<span>And blessed the speaker for the 'perfect work.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Speedily from her sight they floated out;<br /></span>
<span>But, long time, while gazing, they saw her stand<br /></span>
<span>In desolate beauty, silent on the beach.<br /></span>
<span>The plaintive music of a horn wound down<br /></span>
<span>From <em class="smcap">Wole's</em> grey fortress; all the fading scene<br /></span>
<span>Lay, like a sad thought in a musing breast<br /></span>
<span>Called up by the enchantment of sweet sound&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A thought, no more&mdash;all,&mdash;save those lustrous eyes<br /></span>
<span>Shining upon them like two troubled stars&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Vaguely receding into things that were:<br /></span>
<span>While, high and low, in whispering melodies<br /></span>
<span>Borne by the uncertain winds, a farewell came:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oh, when for love we pine<br /></span>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
